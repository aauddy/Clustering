This project is to create food product clusters based on its nutritional content.
The dataset has 1463 unique products and 48 features. We create a subset of data – considering all those data having less than 26 NA’s.
The subset has 60 rows. We clean the dataset by removing the duplicate products and replacing the missing values with 0.
We also set the row names of the data frame as the product names.
After cleaning we are left with 50 products. We also scaled the data, 
The clustering model would be using the features to build clusters to achieve internal cohesion and external separation.
